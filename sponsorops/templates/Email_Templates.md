## TEMPLATE 1: NEW SPONSOR (First Contact)

**Subject:** [Your Town] Robotics Students - Brief Introduction

Dear [Name/Title],

I'm [Your Name], and I'm part of [Team Name/Number], a FIRST Robotics Competition team based in [Your Town]. We're a group of [X] high school students who design, build, and compete with 120-pound robots in just 6 weeks.

I'm reaching out because [PERSONALIZED REASON - fill this in based on your research]:
   Example: "we noticed [Company Name] specializes in advanced manufacturing, and we're developing our own CNC and 3D printing capabilities this season"
   Example: "your company's commitment to STEM education aligns closely with our mission to inspire young engineers"
   Example: "[Company Name] is a pillar of our local community, and we're training the next generation of technical talent right here in [Town]"

We'd love the opportunity to introduce ourselves and share what we're working on this season. Would you have 15-20 minutes for a brief call or visit? We're happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for considering this!

### TEMPLATE 1 - KEY CUSTOMIZATION POINTS:

**[PERSONALIZED REASON] is THE MOST IMPORTANT PART!**

This comes from your detective work. It should mention:
- Something specific about THEM (their industry, mission, or community work)
- Something specific about US (what we're doing this year)
- Why there's a natural connection

**Good examples:**
- "we noticed XYZ Manufacturing works with precision robotics, and we're implementing computer vision on our competition robot this season"
- "your scholarship program for engineering students shows you're invested in developing future talent, and our team has sent 15 students into engineering programs over the last 3 years"
- "as Holland's largest employer in advanced manufacturing, you're shaping the future of our local economy - and we're training students in those same skills"

**Bad examples (too generic):**
- "your company seems successful"
- "we need sponsors"
- "you probably care about robotics"

- [Student impact: "Grew our team to 35 students, including 12 who are now pursuing engineering degrees"]
- [Cool accomplishment: "Successfully implemented swerve drive and autonomous navigation"]

Your partnership made a real difference for our students, and we're grateful.

**Looking ahead to the 2025 season:**
We're kicking off our build season on [date] with some exciting new challenges. [Optional: 1 sentence about this year's game or team goals - "We're focused on qualifying for the State Championship and implementing advanced computer vision."]

We'd love to have [Company Name] continue as a partner in our mission to inspire young engineers. Would you be available for a brief call to discuss this year's partnership opportunities? I'd also be happy to arrange a team visit or presentation if you'd like to see what we're up to.

### TEMPLATE 2 - KEY CUSTOMIZATION POINTS:

**The "With your help" section:**
- Be SPECIFIC about what you accomplished
- Include numbers where possible (X competitions, Y students, Z achievement)
- Mix competition success with student impact
- Make them feel like they were part of something awesome

**Tone adjustment:**

- If it was more formal: Keep it professional
- If you're not sure: Start professional, they'll match your tone in reply

**Example - Casual version for close relationship:**
"Hi Sarah,

Hope you're doing well! The [Team Name] robotics team is gearing up for another season, and we wanted to reach out.

First off - huge thank you for supporting us last year. Because of partners like XYZ Corp, we were able to compete at 3 tournaments and came within 2 spots of making State Championship. Even better, we grew to 35 students and 5 of our seniors are headed to engineering programs next fall!

This year's game just dropped and we're fired up about our chances. We're implementing some new tech and really going for that State Championship spot. Would love to have you back on board!

Are you available for a quick call to chat about this season's partnership? Happy to work around your schedule, or we could even bring some students by to give you an update in person.

Thanks for everything you do for our program!

[Your Name]"

## QUICK REFERENCE: Email Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Keep it under 150 words
✅ Personalize the "why you" sentence
✅ Ask for a conversation, not money
✅ Include specific team details (team number, town, size)
✅ Make it easy to say yes (offer to work around their schedule)
✅ Proofread carefully!

### DON'T:
❌ Send a generic blast email to 50 companies
❌ Ask for a specific dollar amount in first email
❌ Write a novel about your team's entire history
❌ Use jargon they won't understand ("we need help with our swerve drivetrain")
❌ Sound desperate
❌ Forget to include contact info

**Subject:** Following up - [Team Name] Introduction

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from [date] about [Team Name/Number], our local FIRST Robotics team.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief - we're a group of [X] students building robots and learning engineering, and we'd love a few minutes to introduce ourselves and our program.

If now isn't a good time, no worries at all! But if you have 15 minutes for a quick call, we'd really appreciate it.

Thanks for your time!

Looking forward to it!"

**Then prepare for the meeting:**
- Bring 2-3 students (not just 1, shows it's a real team)
- Prepare a 5-minute overview of team
- Have specific "asks" ready (we'll work on this next!)
- Bring photos/videos of robot if you have them
