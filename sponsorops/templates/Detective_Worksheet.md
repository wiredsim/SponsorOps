## STEP 4: THE PERSONALIZATION SENTENCE ⭐

**This is the most important part!**

Based on everything you found above, complete this sentence:

**"We're reaching out to [Company Name] because..."**

_____________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________


### Does your sentence include:
☐ Something specific about THEM (their industry, values, or community work)
☐ Something specific about US (our team, what we're learning, our goals)
☐ A natural connection between the two

### Examples of GOOD personalized sentences:

✅ "...you specialize in precision manufacturing and we're developing our own CNC and 3D printing capabilities this season"

✅ "...your scholarship program shows you're invested in developing future engineers, and our team has sent 15 students into engineering programs"

✅ "...as Holland's largest employer, you're shaping our community's future, and we're training students in the exact technical skills local employers need"

✅ "...you've been supporting our community for 50 years, and as a local robotics team, we're inspiring the next generation right here in town"

### Examples of BAD (too generic) sentences:

❌ "...you're a successful company"
❌ "...we need sponsors"  
❌ "...you probably care about robotics"
❌ "...we found you online"

**If your sentence feels generic, go back and find ONE more specific thing about them!**

---

## STEP 5: FINAL CHECK

Before moving on to write your email:

☐ I found their website and it looks legitimate
☐ I have a contact person name (or made my best guess)
☐ I found at least ONE specific thing about them to mention
☐ My personalization sentence feels natural and specific
☐ I'm ready to write the email!

**Score yourself:**

If you checked ALL 5 boxes above:
🔥 **HOT LEAD** - Write this email first!

If you checked 3-4 boxes:
⚠️ **WARM LEAD** - Good prospect, write the email

If you checked 1-2 boxes:
❄️ **COLD LEAD** - Maybe skip this one and pick a better company
